# Changelog 🕊️

All notable changes to `@birdcc/vscode` will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-03-03

### ✨ Added

- 🎯 **Format Selection** — Register `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider` so you can now format selected code blocks, not just the entire document.
- 🖱️ **Editor Context Menu** — Right-click in the editor to access `BIRD2: Validate Active Document` and `BIRD2: Format Active Document` instantly.
- 📖 **Hover Documentation** — Keyword hover provider is here! Hover over BIRD2 keywords to see helpful documentation powered by YAML data.
- ⚡ **Real-time Fallback Validation** — Added `onDidChangeTextDocument` trigger for real-time diagnostics when running in fallback mode (no LSP server needed).

### 🔧 Improved

- 🛡️ **Status Bar Stability** — Hardened status-bar lifecycle initialization to eliminate unsafe early access patterns.
- 🔄 **Docs Sync Workflow** — Hover docs now use a shared YAML synchronization workflow via `sync:hover-docs` for easier maintenance.
