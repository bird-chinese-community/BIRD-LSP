# Changelog 🕊️

All notable changes to `@birdcc/vscode` will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-03

### 🐛 Fixed

- 🧩 **Activation Reliability** — Added explicit `onCommand:*` activation events so command invocations always trigger extension activation.
- 🖱️ **Context Menu Visibility** — Fixed `menus.when` expressions by quoting `'bird2'`, restoring expected right-click menu visibility logic.
- 🌐 **Remote Workspace Compatibility** — Relaxed editor feature selectors to support non-`file` BIRD2 documents (for example remote workspaces), restoring hover/format/type-hint registration in these scenarios.
- 📝 **Runtime Logging** — Switched to log output channel mode and added lifecycle log lines to make startup/teardown diagnosis visible from output logs.
- 🧷 **Hover Fault Isolation** — Made hover docs module loading lazy so hover dependency failures no longer block full extension activation.
- 🚚 **Marketplace Workflow Paths** — Updated CI artifact upload/download paths to use `release/bird2-lsp.vsix`, matching the new packaging layout.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-03

### 🐛 Fixed

- 📦 **Runtime Dependencies in VSIX** — Fix extension activation failure (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`) by packaging runtime dependencies into the VSIX artifact.
- 🧭 **Release Artifact Location** — Move packaged VSIX output from `dist/` to `release/` to avoid mixing distribution files with TypeScript build output.
- 🗂️ **Packaging Completeness** — Ensure runtime data files and dependency tree are included for offline VSIX installs.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-03-03

### ✨ Added

- 🎯 **Format Selection** — Register `DocumentRangeFormattingEditProvider` so you can now format selected code blocks, not just the entire document.
- 🖱️ **Editor Context Menu** — Right-click in the editor to access `BIRD2: Validate Active Document` and `BIRD2: Format Active Document` instantly.
- 📖 **Hover Documentation** — Keyword hover provider is here! Hover over BIRD2 keywords to see helpful documentation powered by YAML data.
- ⚡ **Real-time Fallback Validation** — Added `onDidChangeTextDocument` trigger for real-time diagnostics when running in fallback mode (no LSP server needed).

### 🔧 Improved

- 🛡️ **Status Bar Stability** — Hardened status-bar lifecycle initialization to eliminate unsafe early access patterns.
- 🔄 **Docs Sync Workflow** — Hover docs now use a shared YAML synchronization workflow via `sync:hover-docs` for easier maintenance.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2025-03-02

### 🔧 Improved

- 🎨 **Marketplace Icon** — Added `icon` metadata so the extension icon now displays beautifully in VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX.
- 🧹 **Cleaner Packaging** — Prevent nested VSIX artifacts by cleaning stale `dist/bird2-lsp.vsix` before packaging.

---
